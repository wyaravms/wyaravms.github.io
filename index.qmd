## Hello!

I'm Wyara and welcome to my website! 

I'm a statistician currently pursuing a Doctoral Degree in Statistics from the Graduate Program at UFMG. 

On this website, I'll be sharing notes, tests, codes, and other things I've done and will do during my academic journey. 

When I'm not studying, you can find me sipping coffee or enjoying a good movie. I'm also an orange belt in karate. Osu!
