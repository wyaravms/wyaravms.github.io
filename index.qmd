Hi! Welcome to my website!

I'm a statistician currently working towards a Doctoral Degree in Statistics at the Graduate Program at UFMG. Here, I'll be sharing notes, tests, codes, and more from my academic journey. 

When I'm not studying, you can catch me enjoying coffee, watching films, or practicing karate as a proficient green belt. Osu!
