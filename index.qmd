Hi! I'm a statistician and a PhD student in the Graduate Program in Statistics at UFMG. My life revolves around numbers, research, and a constant pursuit of knowledge. Beyond that, I'm passionate about coffee, a true enthusiast of cinema, and I also enjoy practicing karate, proudly holding my purple belt.
